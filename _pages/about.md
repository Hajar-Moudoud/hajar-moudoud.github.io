## Biography

I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO). My research focuses on cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on network security and resilience, AI applications in cybersecurity, and secure edge intelligence.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Technology of Troyes, France, and a Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Sherbrooke, Canada, both in 2022. Prior to my current position, I worked as a researcher focusing on IoT security, blockchain applications, and machine learning for cybersecurity.

My research has been published in top-tier venues and flagship conferences. My work was recognized with several best paper awards at IEEE conferences, including IEEE LCN 2021 and IEEE IMETA 2024. I have established international collaborations including CNAM Paris University and Sharjah University. I am particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, developing innovative solutions for securing IoT ecosystems and implementing blockchain technologies for enhanced security frameworks.
